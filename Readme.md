In the course Programming1 we will use Python. Python has become one of the most important language for data science, machine learning, and general software development in acedamia and industry. In recent years Python improved support for libraries making the language suitable for data analysis applications. In this master course we will use some of the most essential python libraries for data analysis: `NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `bokeh` and `statsmodels`. Programming1 will mostly use NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and scipy.

### numpy

NumPy (http://numpy.org) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Beyond the fast array-processing capabilities that NumPy adds to Python, it is often used to pass data between algorithms and libraries. It is more efficient for storing and manipulating data than other Python data structures. More documentation is to be found on https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy and a good cheat sheet is https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-blog-files/numpy-cheat-sheet.pdf

### pandas

Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org) is an open sourcelibrary providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Pandas blends the high-performance array computing ideas of NumPy with the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases. It provides indexing functionality making it easy to reshape, slice, perform aggregations and select subsets. It has flexible handling of missing data. It is a nice tool to organize, clean and analyse the data. More documentation is to be found at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/ and a good cheat sheet is https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

### matplotlib

matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org) is a popular library for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualisations. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publications. More documentation is to be found on https://matplotlib.org/contents.html and a good cheat sheet is https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Matplotlib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

### bokeh
Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for web browsers. It provides high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. More documentation can be found on https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/

### scipy 

scipy (http://scipy.org) is a collection of packages addressing a number of different domains in computer sciences. It can be used for numerical integration routines and differential equation solvers, linear algebra, rootfinding algorithms, signal processing, matrix calculations, special distributions and various statistical tests. 

### scikit-learn

scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org) is a great machine learning toolkit for Python. It can handle thins like preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, dimensional reduction and model selection. scikit will not be part of this programming model. 

### statsmodels

statsmodels (http://statsmodels.org) is a statistical analysis package. Compared to scikit-learn statsmodels contains more classical statistics like regression, ANOVA, time series, nonparametic models and some visualisation. It is more focussed on statistical inference providing p-values compared to scikit-learn that is more focussed on prediction. 

## Structure of this course

The programming 1 course will be a seven week course. Each week the following subjects are lectured

- software development strategies
- how to get data
- how to organize and analyse data
- working on a practical assignment

The course uses the Python language and basic Object-Oriented principles as a base. We will mainly focus on several aspects related to the lean/agile software development process, with a quantified self (quantified us) problem as learning case. Design patterns and principles, clean code principles and testing strategies will be discussed. There will be an emphasis on different ways to tackle large and/or complex data layers. Next to the provided lectures and tutorials self study is expected.
