    "# The Builder Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The builder pattern is used in the case that we want to create an object that is composed of multiple parts and the composition needs to be done step by step. The builder pattern seperates the the construction of complex object from its representation. By keeping the construction seperate from the respresentation, the same construction can be used to create different representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example is the construction of a HTML page. The basic construction is the same but the representation of each page differs. The page is usually build step by step. One function adds the title, one function adds the main header, another the footer and so on. Only after the whole page is constructed it can be shown to the reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the builder pattern there are two main participants.\n",
    "* the builder. The component responsible for creating various parts of the complex object. \n",
    "* the director. The component that controls the building process using a builder instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"director\" invokes \"builder\" services as it interprets the external format. The \"builder\" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state. When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the \"builder\". In the example above each pages uses a different builder instance to create the webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "Check list\n",
    "* Decide if a common input and many possible representations (or outputs) is the problem at hand.\n",
    "* Encapsulate the parsing of the common input in a Reader class.\n",
    "* Design a standard protocol for creating all possible output representations. Capture the steps of this protocol in a Builder interface.\n",
    "* Define a Builder derived class for each target representation.\n",
    "* The client creates a Reader object and a Builder object, and registers the latter with the former.\n",
    "* The client asks the Reader to \"construct\".\n",
    "* The client asks the Builder to return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes creational patterns are complementary: Builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components get built. Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype can use Singleton in their implementations.\n",
    "* Builder focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. Abstract Factory emphasizes a family of product objects (either simple or complex). Builder returns the product as a final step, but as far as the Abstract Factory is concerned, the product gets returned immediately.\n",
    "* Builder often builds a Composite.\n",
    "* Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed\n",
