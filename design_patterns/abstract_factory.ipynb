    "# The abstract factory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract factory design pattern is a generalization of the factory method. It is a logical group of factory methods, where each factory method is responsible for creating a different kind of object. Using the factory pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "* makes tracking of an object easier\n",
    "* decouples object creation from object usage\n",
    "* improves performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Usely you can start with a simple factory method. If you end up with many factory methods is better practice to organize and group them into an abstract factory. \n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of the abstract factory is that it gives us the ability to modify the behavior of the application runtime by changing the active factory method. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this abstract factory we use a simple example. As part of our application we want to run a game, but depending on the age of the user we would like to launch the game for children or for adults. The abstract factory will take care of the game creation part. First we have a look at the body. We see that depending on the age the `game` is set to either `FrogWorld` class or `WizardWorld` class. This class is used as an input in the class `GameEnvironment` where it is parsed to the factory parameter. It creates a hero (`factory.make_character()`) and an obstacle `factory.make_obstacle()`. The `play` method initiates the interaction between the created hero and obstacle. \n"
